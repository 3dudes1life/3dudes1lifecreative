    <h1>Welcome to 3Dudes1Life Creative</h1>
    <p class="intro">D.C.W. created 3Dudes1Life Creative to celebrate the ups, downs, and deep connection found in loving more than one person at a time. They hope their stories inspire others to embrace their truth, redefine relationships on their own terms, and never settle for anything less than magic. This brand will manage social, the book series, the blog, and whatever is to come.</p>

      <h2>Who We Are</h2>
      <p>D.C.W. = Daniel, Caleb, and Will have been building a life together for nearly a decade. As a real-life throuple, they’ve shared everything from wild travel adventures and cozy Sunday breakfasts, to owning a business, raising two lovable dogs, and maybe even cohabiting with a ghost (their house definitely has vibes). <p>
      When they're not writing, you can find them working in their garden, planning their future in Hawaii, or answering questions on their blog, 3Dudes1Life.</p>
