    <h1>Welcome to 3Dudes1Life Creative</h1>
    <p class="intro">D.C.W. created 3Dudes1Life Creative to celebrate the ups, downs, and deep connection found in loving more than one person at a time. They hope their stories inspire others to embrace their truth, redefine relationships on their own terms, and never settle for anything less than magic. This brand will manage social, the book series, the blog, and whatever is to come.</p>

      <h2>Who We Are</h2>
      <p>D.C.W. = Daniel, Caleb, and Will have been building a life together for nearly a decade. As a real-life throuple, they’ve shared everything from wild travel adventures and cozy Sunday breakfasts, to owning a business, raising two lovable dogs, and maybe even cohabiting with a ghost (their house definitely has vibes). <p>
      When they're not writing, you can find them working in their garden, planning their future in Hawaii, or answering questions on their blog, 3Dudes1Life.</p>

      <h2>📚 Tres Amigos, Una Vida</h2>
      <img src="book-cover.png" alt="Book Cover" class="book-cover" />
      <p>What happens when three wildly different men—an emotionally guarded Navy mechanic from Oklahoma, a tattooed culinary specialist from a tiny Florida town, and a sharp-tongued tech heir from San Francisco—collide at exactly the wrong time... and it feels perfectly right? <p>
From secret glances in the mess hall to fights that end in laughter under the same blanket, Tres Amigos, Una Vida follows a raw and unforgettable path through love, vulnerability, and devotion. Over years, through deployments, cities, and shifting definitions of home, their story asks one question: what if your forever isn’t just one person—but two? <p>
This isn’t your typical romance. This is the story of how three men fall in love—messily, deeply, and against all odds. It’s about what it really means to build a life together when the world keeps trying to pull you apart.<p>
Inspired by true events from a real-life throuple who’ve spent a decade building a life—and love—together. </p>
