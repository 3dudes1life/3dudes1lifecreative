      <h2>Who We Are</h2>
      <p>
        D.C.W. = Daniel, Caleb, and Will have been building a life together for nearly a decade. As a real-life throuple,
        they’ve shared everything from wild travel adventures and cozy Sunday breakfasts, to owning a business,
        raising two lovable dogs, and maybe even cohabiting with a ghost (their house definitely has vibes).
      </p>
      <p>
        When they're not writing, you can find them working in their garden, planning their future in Hawaii,
        or answering questions on their blog, 3Dudes1Life.

      <h2>📚 Tres Amigos, Una Vida</h2>
      <img src="book-cover.png" alt="Book Cover" class="book-cover" />
      <p>
        What happens when three wildly different men—an emotionally guarded Navy mechanic from Oklahoma, a tattooed culinary specialist
        from a tiny Florida town, and a sharp-tongued tech heir from San Francisco—collide at exactly the wrong time... and it feels perfectly right?
      </p>
      <p>
        From secret glances in the mess hall to fights that end in laughter under the same blanket, <em>Tres Amigos, Una Vida</em>
        follows a raw and unforgettable path through love, vulnerability, and devotion. Over years, through deployments, cities, and shifting
        definitions of home, their story asks one question: what if your forever isn’t just one person—but two?
      </p>
      <p>
        This isn’t your typical romance. This is the story of how three men fall in love—messily, deeply, and against all odds.
        It’s about what it really means to build a life together when the world keeps trying to pull you apart.
      </p>
      <p>Inspired by true events from a real-life throuple who’ve spent a decade building a life—and love—together.</p>
